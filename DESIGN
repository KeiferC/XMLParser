Functions:
1) File IO
        a) Read in an XML file
                - Assert: file has to be XML
        b) Write to file type of choice
                - Main immediate focus: CSV
                - TODO: determine other file types

2) Parse XML into data structure
        a) Data structure: 2D list (list of table rows)
                - Justification: quick CSV conversion,
                                 no need for data manipulation,
                                 read: O(n)
                                 write: O(n)
        b) Algorithm:
                1)
